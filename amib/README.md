## Design

This challenge mimics dumb shareware registration mechanisms from early-2000s.

- `amib` implements a registration key checker.
- The program generates a machine code based on the "name of the motherboard" (who knows what that means).
- The user provides a user name.
- The registration key satisfies the following equation: `decrypt(reg_key) == MD5(username + "|" + machinecode)`.
- The challenge will send all information to our server for verification, and once verification succeeds, the server sends down some binary code that is unencrypted.
- The challenge decrypts the binary code and runs it, which will extract the second flag on the stack.
- How about the first flag? If the user fails registration for 4096 times, the challenge will check if the registration key equals the first flag, which is encoded as the result of a "Lights Out" game.

## Anti-debugging & obfuscation

The only obfuscation exists is that we construct some strings in memory. Really stupid.
